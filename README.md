## Instruction
This is a client for UNO. You can play UNO in the client (when we finish this project) with your friend.

This client should work with [UNO_Server](https://github.com/dthcle/UNO_Server)

Now we can login/logout and begin the game(not play the game). Server will send the initial data to its target.
## How to use
Run the server, then run the client.

The client can run correctly in Windows PowerShell. I don't know can it run correctly on other terminal.

If you want to change the server address and server port, you can change it in the [CONST.py](./CONST.py)

PS: The tests so far have been run locally and match matches with a number of players of 1.
## Structure
As the filename says, every file's function is clearly.
