## Instruction
This is a client for UNO. You can play UNO in the client (when we finish this project) with your friend.
This client should work with [UNO_Server](https://github.com/dthcle/UNO_Server)
I just complete the login function. I will update it after a while.
## How to use
Run the server, then run the client.
If you want to change the server address and server port, you can change it in the [CONST.py](./CONST.py)
## Structure
As the filename says, every file's function is clearly.
